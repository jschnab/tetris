# Tetris in Python

## Overview and disclaimer

This repository contains a single Python file that implements a simple version
of Tetris programmed 100% in Python. The graphical interface is made with
`tkinter`.

I implemented this game as an exercice and a little challenge to myself. I
wrote the source code in about ten hours, after work, so the game quality
reflects it. The purpose of this project being a programming challenge,
I did not spend tons of effort fixing little bugs that have more to do with
coding details than general architecture. I hope you won't find them too
annoying. I intended to include most basic functionality of the
original game, so I think it's a fun experience anyway.

However, the goal was not to be super true to the original, or follow any
publicly available source code reference. The present game is *my own view*
of Tetris, reversed engineered from memory, so you may be disappointed by
how different this is compared to your own Tetris experience.

## How to run

Just run the following command on the command line interface:

```
python3 main.py
```
